# Semantic Feature Mapping - Learning from Test Cases of Other Apps

This repository stores artefacts used for the evaluation of semantic feature mapping.

## Information

In accordance to the ICSE 2018 regulations of [double blind reviewing](http://www.icse2018.org/track/icse-2018-Double-blind-review) and to avoid potential privacy/security leaks, we tried to anonymize the provided data as good as possible. After the review process is complete, you can also can get access to the **network profile data** and the **screenshots** (used for debugging purpose). The meta-data used in presented in the archive describes in our own words, what the overall functionality of the state was, but was not used for calculating matchings.

We spend our best effort to replace revealing descriptions in the data using the string `BLINDED`, without rendering the data useless by destroying the structure. You still might find *revealing* data if you spend serious effort.
